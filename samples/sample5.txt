Computation
 is any type of calculation
[1]
[2]
 that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and follows a well-defined model, for example an 
algorithm
.

The study of computation is paramount (
hypernymous
) to the discipline of 
computer science
.

A computation can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed 
physical system
 called a 
computer
.
Examples of such physical systems include 
digital computers
, 
mechanical computers
, 
quantum computers
, 
DNA computers
, 
molecular computers
, microfluidics-based computers, 
analog computers
, or 
wetware computers
.
This point of view has been adopted by the 
physics of computation
, a branch of theoretical physics, as well as the field of 
natural computing
.

An even more radical point of view, 
pancomputationalism
, is the postulate of 
digital physics
 that argues that the evolution of the universe is itself a computation.

The classic account of computation is found throughout the works of 
Hilary Putnam
 and others. 
Peter Godfrey-Smith
 has dubbed this the "simple mapping account."
[3]
 
Gualtiero Piccinini's
 summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system to the computation such that the “microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.”
[4]


Philosophers such as 
Jerry Fodor
[5]
 have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that 
semantic
 content be a necessary condition for computation (that is, what differentiates an arbitrary physical system from a computing system is that the operands of the computation represent something).  This notion attempts to prevent the logical abstraction of the mapping account of 
pancomputationalism
, the idea that everything can be said to be computing everything.

Gualtiero Piccinini
 proposes an account of computation based in 
mechanical philosophy
.  It states that physical computing systems are types of mechanisms that, by design, perform physical computation, or “the manipulation (by a functional mechanism) of a medium-independent vehicle according to a rule.”  Medium-independence requires that the property is able to be instantiated by multiple realizers and multiple mechanisms and that the inputs and outputs of the mechanism also be 
 multiply realizable
.  In short, medium-independence allows for the use of physical variables with traits other than voltage (as in typical digital computers); this is imperative in considering other types of computation, such as that occurs in the 
brain
 or in a 
quantum computer
.  A rule, in this sense, provides a mapping among inputs, outputs, and internal states of the physical computing system.

In the 
theory of computation
, a diversity of mathematical models of computers has been developed.
Typical mathematical 
models of computers
 are the following:

Giunti calls the models studied by computation theory 
computational systems,
 and he argues that all of them are mathematical 
dynamical systems
 with discrete time and discrete state space.

 He maintains that a computational system is a complex object which consists of three parts. First, a mathematical dynamical system
